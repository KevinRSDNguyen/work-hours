Work Hours allows you to find out how many hours of work you will need to afford an item after your wages, sales tax, and income taxes are accounted for.

Time is money; this is how I have always viewed purchasing goods. For example,if you make $10 an hour and your movie ticket costs $20, you would think it would take you 2 hours of work to afford it. But that ticket really costs $22 after sales tax is added, and at $10 an hour your federal income taxes are 8%, so you really only make $9.20 an hour.

After sales tax and income taxes are taken into account, that $20 movie ticket actually costs you 2 hours and 25 minutes of work. Sound complicated? Fortunately, Work Hours does all these calculations with just a few inputs.
